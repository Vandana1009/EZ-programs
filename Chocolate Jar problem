'''Chocolate jar
You are given an integer array of size N, representing jars of chocolates. Three students A, B, 
and C respectively, will pick chocolates one by one from each chocolate jar, till the jar is 
empty, and then repeat the same with the rest of the jars. Your task is to fine and return an 
integer value representing the total number of chocolates that student A will have, after all 
the chocolates have been picked from all the jars. 
Note: Once a jar is done A will start taking the chocolates from the new jar. '''


def chocolates_for_A(jars, N):
    chocolates_A = 0
    
    for jar in jars:
        chocolates_left = jar
        turn = 0  # 0 for A, 1 for B, 2 for C
        
        while chocolates_left > 0:
            if turn == 0:  # It's A's turn
                chocolates_A += 1
            
            # Reduce the chocolate count as a chocolate is picked by one of the students
            chocolates_left -= 1
            
            # Move to the next student's turn
            turn = (turn + 1) % 3
    
    return chocolates_A

# Example Usage
jars = [5, 3, 7]
N = len(jars)
print(chocolates_for_A(jars, N))  # Output will be the total chocolates picked by A

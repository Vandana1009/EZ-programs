Context:
A financial services company, FutureInvest, uses advanced mathematical 
models to forecast market trends and make investment decisions. One of the 
models they use is based on the Fibonacci sequence due to its relevance in 
technical analysis, particularly in identifying retracement levels and predicting 
future price movements.

Scenario:
FutureInvest analysts need a reliable tool that can generate the Fibonacci 
sequence up to a specified number of terms. This tool will help them in 
creating Fibonacci retracement levels, which are critical for predicting potential 
reversal points in the financial markets. The accuracy and efficiency of 
generating these sequences are crucial for timely and effective decisionmaking.

Context:
A leading aerospace company, OrbitTech, is developing a satellite 
communication system that relies heavily on secure data transmission. The 
encryption keys used for securing communication between satellites and 
ground stations are generated based on prime numbers. To ensure the integrity 
and security of these keys, it is crucial to verify the primality of large numbers 
efficiently in real-time.

Scenario:
OrbitTech's satellite communication system requires real-time verification of 
prime numbers during the generation of encryption keys. Given the high-stakes 
nature of satellite data transmission, any delay or error in prime verification 
could compromise the security and efficiency of the system. Therefore, 
OrbitTech needs a reliable and efficient solution to check if given numbers are 
prime.
